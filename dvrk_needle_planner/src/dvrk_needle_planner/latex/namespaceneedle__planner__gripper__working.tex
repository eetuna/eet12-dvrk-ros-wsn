\subsection{Detailed Description}
\begin{DoxyVerb}library to compute gripper poses to perform needle driving
# main fnc is: def compute_needle_drive_gripper_affines(...)
# need to specify tissue properties (w/rt camera frame)
# Also specify grasp transform (or accept the default) and choose which arm (or accept default=PSM1)
# provide tissue entrance pt, exit pt and surface normal (w/rt camera frame)
# Get back a vector of affines of corresponding gripper affines, wrt camera frame
# (really, inputs/outputs w/rt whatever frame is of interest, but presumably camera frame)


# NEEDLE-DRIVE ASSUMPTIONS:  
# this code assumes needle driving will be in a circular arc about the needle center
# The needle center is defined as the center of the circle that contains the needle semi-circle
#  This is defined as the origin of the needle frame. The z-axis of the needle frame, bvec_needle,
# is defined perpendicular to the needle plane, with positive direction corresponding to
# needle driving with the tip leading (a requirement) corresponds to positive rotation about
# the needle z axis.
# at present, this code assumes rotation of the needle during driving is about 
# an axis parallel to the tissue surface, i.e. needle z-axis is perpendicular to tissue normal
#  (this is not required, but common)

# NEEDLE GRASP ASSUMPTIONS:
# this code does not care which arm is used; all gripper affines are computed to achieve
# a needle-drive path; not arm IK is performed here

# one can choose where on the circumference of the needle to grab it--but pragmatically,
# one will grab the needle as close to the needle tail as possible (i.e., as far from the 
# needle point as possible), so as to minimize requirements for re-grasping during needle driving
# The choice of where along the circumference to grab the needle is phi_grab_
# Define this as: phi_grab_=0 means to grab the needle in the center of its arc;
# phi_grab_ = +pi/2 means to grab the needle at its tail (should make this pi/2- half_gripper_width
#   to get a full grasp).  phi_grab_ = -pi/2 would mean to grab the gripper tip (not useful for
#  needle driving).

# a common grasp strategy is to hold the needle such that its plane is perpendicular to
# the gripper z-axis, i.e. the needle bvec_needle = +/- bvec_gripper; this is not required in general,
# but it is the default grasp pose for this code

# One must choose the contact points on the gripper where the needle will be held.  The
# default assumption for this code is that the needle will be grabbed half-way between the
# gripper tips and the gripper-jaw joint.  This is changeable via a "set" call.

# With the constraint that the needle plane is perpendicular to the gripper bvec_gripper, there
# are still 4 variations: bvec_needle = +/- bvec_gripper, and needle origin along positive or
# negative gripper y-axis (tvec_gripper).  These may by: 1) selecting direction of bvec_needle
#  (e.g., parallel or antiparallel to bvec_gripper), and 2) choosing "needle_plus_y" or "needle_ninus_y".
# For bvec_needle parallel or antiparallel to bvec_gripper, "needle_plus_y" means that the needle 
# origin will lie on the positive tvec_gripper axis; "needle_minus_y" means that the needle lies on
# the negative tvec_gripper axis.
# More generally, the needle z-axis, bvec_needle, does not have to be parallel or antiparallel to
# the gripper bvec_gripper.  In this case, the needle origin will not lie on the gripper tvec_gripper
# axis.  However, the needle origin would lie in either the positive-y half space of the gripper frame
# or the negative-y half-space of the gripper frame, and the designation "needle_plus_y" would
# still be meaningful.  However, this does not cover the special case where the plane of the needle
# contains bvec_gripper.  In this case, the needle origin will lie at y/gripper = 0.  If this case
# This case is not covered here.


# a common grasp is to have the needle surface-tangent parallel or antiparallel to the gripper x axis at 
#  the grasp location ,i.e. the needle extends out perpendicular to the jaws, i.e.
#  needle tangent  is perpendicular to gripper bvec
# it is also common to have the needle z-axis parallel to or antiparallel to the gripper z axis:
# bvec_needle || bvec_gripper, or bvec_needle || -bvec_gripper
#  That is, the needle origin lies along the (plus or minus) gripper y axis.
# Define the needle-frame x-axis as pointing from needle center (origin) towards needle tip
# Approximately, if grab the needle as far as possible from the needle tip, 
# and this grasp has needle bvec_needle || +/- bvec_gripper, then the needle tip 
# tip would also lie along the\end{DoxyVerb}
